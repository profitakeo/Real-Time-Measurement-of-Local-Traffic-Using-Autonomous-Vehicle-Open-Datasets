# Real Time Measurement of Local Traffic Using Autonomous Vehicle Open Datasets
This thesis measures localised traffic using AV LiDAR data from Waymo Open Dataset in U.S. cities such as San Francisco, Phoenix and Mountain View.
It has been submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Civil Engineering (Honours) at UNSW.

## Inspiration
This thesis is based on the [Waymo Open Dataset Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb).

## Technologies
- Python 3.6 
- R 3.6.1
- TensorFlow 1.15.2

## Launch
1. Download [Waymo Open Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/download/)
2. Run Python file using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) to calculate traffic for all frames of a video
3. Run R file to visualise space-time, time series and birds eye view
